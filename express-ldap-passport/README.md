# express-ldap-passport

In order to understand passport with ldap, one has to start someplace

The app.js is a simple http://expressjs.com/starter/generator.html .

Then read http://passportjs.org/guide/ and  https://github.com/auth0/passport-windowsauth 

The app.js has components that are commented out: these are the passport components that are needed so that the app.js is enabled with passport and ldap.

And it worked for me ...

Note: There are several passport ldap implementations, I just picked the first one I found.
